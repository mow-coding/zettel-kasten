# Upgrade Guide

[한국어 업그레이드 가이드](UPGRADE.ko.md)

This guide explains how to move between public `zettel-kasten` / `zet` versions.

The project is versioned because archive rules, zettel metadata, object manifests, provenance records, and future `zet` sharing envelopes must be understandable across users and tools.

## Quick Rule

```text
PATCH upgrade -> documentation, validation, or compatible fixes
MINOR upgrade -> compatible new features or optional fields
MAJOR upgrade -> breaking protocol/schema changes
```

Before upgrading a real archive:

1. Read the target version note in `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/`.
2. Back up the private archive repository and object manifests.
3. Run `archive doctor --strict`.
4. Run migration commands in dry-run mode first when available.
5. Commit private archive changes only after reviewing generated receipts.

The archive should never silently rewrite memory.

## Public Versions

| Version | Status | Upgrade note |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `v0.2.8` | current public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.8.md` |
| `v0.2.7` | superseded public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.7.md` |
| `v0.2.6` | superseded public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.6.md` |
| `v0.2.5` | superseded public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.5.md` |
| `v0.2.4` | superseded public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.4.md` |
| `v0.2.3` | superseded public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.3.md` |
| `v0.2.2` | superseded public pre-release | `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/v0.2.2.md` |

## From `v0.2.7` To `v0.2.8`

This is a compatible minting lifecycle feature patch.

What changed:

- added `archive mint-zettel --dry-run`,
- added `archive mint-zettel --approve --reviewed-by <id>`,
- added mint receipts under `receipts/mint/`,
- added draft snapshots under `receipts/mint/drafts/`,
- added canonical zettel `mint` frontmatter,
- added doctor validation for mint receipts and SHA-256 file links,
- added read-only MCP `mint_zettel_check`.

No private archive migration is required.

If you mint new zettels, keep the generated canonical zettel, mint receipt, and draft snapshot together.

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v0.2.8
```

## From `v0.2.3` To `v0.2.4`

This is a documentation polish patch.

What changed:

- rewrote `README.md` as a cleaner English project entrypoint,
- added `README.ko.md` as a full Korean entrypoint,
- split upgrade documentation into English and Korean files,
- clarified the public positioning, current status, privacy boundary, storage model, and text provenance.

No private archive migration is required.

Recommended steps:

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v0.2.4
```

## From `v0.2.2` To `v0.2.3`

This is a bilingual documentation patch.

No private archive migration is required.

```bash
git fetch --tags
git checkout v0.2.3
```

## From `v0.2.1` To `v0.2.2`

This is a documentation, provenance, and public-history hygiene patch.

No private archive migration is required.

Important concept change:

```text
original editable text != OCR/AI-derived text
```

Both should be stored, but OCR/AI-derived text should keep derivation metadata and review status.

## Staying On An Older Version

Users may stay on an older version.

That is part of the design:

```text
old version -> old rule set
new version -> updated rule set
```

Future sharing and collaboration features should make the sender/receiver version explicit.

## Future Release Requirements

Every future public release should include:

- changelog entry,
- release note under `ai-archive-kit/docs/releases/`,
- compatibility statement,
- migration instructions,
- test/doctor verification status,
- privacy scan status,
- Git tag,
- GitHub Release.
