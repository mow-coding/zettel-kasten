# WOM

> Widesider of Modernity: a local-first, AI-native, Web3-oriented archive and communication system for widening the horizon of human perception.

`WOM` stands for `Widesider of Modernity`.

The name expresses the ambition to stand near the frontier of modernity and widen the horizon that humans can perceive.

Inside WOM:

- `zettel-kasten` is the historical root and local archive method,
- `zet` is the unit document minted inside a zettel-kasten,
- `header` is refs, hashes, provenance, policy, and receipts around a zet,
- `block` is `zet + header`,
- `ZET` is the zettel-kasten-based communication layer that can become messaging, SNS/feed, or collaboration,
- `node` is the subject/archive participant,
- the preferred lifecycle is `mint -> delegate -> attest -> anchor`.

`zettel-kasten` remains the repository and archive-system root, but the product language should center `WOM`, `zet`, `ZET`, and `node`.

## Status

Current public baseline:

```text
v0.3.8 pre-release
```

This repository is a public showcase and reference implementation workspace. It is not production-ready yet.

What exists today:

- a public WOM/zet/ZET design baseline with specs, schemas, fake archives, release notes, and work logs,
- WOM-kit local CLI and MCP tooling under `wom-kit/`, importing as `wom_kit`,
- private archive lifecycle tools for doctor checks, draft creation, minting, delegation, receipts, search, and metadata review,
- read-only preview layers for runtime context, profiles, source/objet intake, block headers, prompt boundaries, foreign block review, projection, shared update review/index, shared update route pointers, and ZET would-transport planning,
- approval-gated single-file and JSONL batch derived text capture for registering already extracted parser/OCR/ASR/vision text against source objets,
- approval-gated `.gitignore` repair for missing WOM-kit safe defaults,
- human-guided project intake planning, decision receipts, source-intake context, and objet-capture receipt gates,
- read-only human artifact store planning for WordPress, Joplin, Notion, Obsidian, Evernote, generic Markdown, and generic workspace surfaces,
- approval-gated local write paths for selected private archive, foreign-block review records, and the first v0.3.0 shared update attestation/review record,
- a v0.2.x freeze / v0.3.0 entry boundary document plus a narrow v0.3.0 write boundary that stays local-first and body-safe,
- local public-release hygiene tools for links, Korean product language, privacy, release readiness, and branch-protection planning.

For a status-by-capability view, see the [WOM-kit Capability Matrix](wom-kit/docs/capability-matrix.md).

What does not exist yet:

- production-grade installation and platform support,
- live provider integrations or provider API sync,
- production `ZET` transport, sharing service, feed update, or mirroring delivery,
- real wallet creation, private-key custody, cryptographic signing, token mechanics, payments, staking, consensus, or blockchain integration,
- recommendation fetching, ranking, automatic neighbor feed updates, or provider-backed recommendation services,
- projection-plan apply/write behavior, projection receipts, WordPress publishing, or provider-specific publishing,
- real foreign block import/trust/apply, signed attestation statements, receiver-side acceptance, or automatic shared-block renewal,
- complete prompt-injection prevention, full-auto execution, model training, backpropagation, Redis, queues, or background workers,
- stable `v1.0.0` protocol guarantee.

## Core Model

The base WOM archive model is:

```text
source/original data + metadata + minted zets
```

In other words:

- source/original data is the evidence layer,
- metadata makes sources addressable and auditable,
- minted zets are human-approved archive memory.

The system starts from the archive node, not from a social app.

See [Naming And Terminology](wom-kit/docs/concepts/naming-and-terminology.md) for the current naming freeze.

The public project records are intentionally separated into:

```text
product blueprint / design philosophy
implementation reference research
implementation plans
work logs
```

## What Is `zet`?

A `zet` is always text.

It is a document created by a human, or drafted by AI under human supervision, then minted into a private archive.

In v0.2, zets remain Markdown-compatible for authoring and import compatibility. The long-term canonical/interchange/rendering target is the [WOM Safe HTML Profile](wom-kit/docs/concepts/wom-safe-html-profile.md), not arbitrary HTML.

Minting means:

```text
draft zet -> human review -> canonical private archive record
```

Minting does not mean public posting. External sharing is a separate action.

## Why This Matters

Most tools make users adapt to an application.

WOM takes the opposite direction:

```text
the user's archive stays primary,
AI helps draft and connect memory,
sharing is a deliberate projection from private memory.
```

The future `ZET` communication layer follows this projection model:

```text
1:1 ZET relation       -> messenger
1:many ZET relation    -> social feed / SNS
many:many ZET relation -> collaboration workspace
```

## Storage Model

Objet storage is not only for media files.

In WOM product language, source/original files stored outside Git are `objets`. Cloud and provider APIs may still call the technical storage layer `object storage`.

Original documents and captures are source objects when they are used as evidence:

- `.hwp`
- `.hwpx`
- `.docx`
- `.xlsx`
- `.pdf`
- `.txt`
- `.md`
- `.csv`
- screenshots
- audio/video
- provider exports

Recommended default:

```text
original source files -> local objet store and/or object storage provider
object identity       -> object manifest
derived text          -> provenance-aware derived text records
zets and metadata     -> Git repository
search text           -> SQLite/search index
```

See [Source Object Storage Policy](wom-kit/docs/source-object-storage-policy.md).

For provider setup metadata, WOM-kit can also run a local receipt consistency
check:

```text
archive provider-status <archive-root> --dry-run
```

This CLI command, and the matching MCP `provider_setup_status` tool, check
`provider-bindings.yml` against local provider setup receipts. They do not call
GitHub, create buckets, upload files, push remotes, or verify live provider
account state.

## Text Provenance

Not every text artifact has the same authority.

WOM distinguishes:

```text
L0 original source object
L1 born-digital editable text
L2 parser-extracted text
L3 OCR / speech-to-text / AI transcription
L4 human-reviewed derived text
L5 minted zet
```

OCR and AI transcription are useful, but they are model-dependent derived records. They should keep source object id, derivation method, tool/model version, confidence when available, and review status.

See [Text Provenance Hierarchy](wom-kit/docs/text-provenance-hierarchy.md).

## Quick Verification

```bash
cd wom-kit
python -m unittest discover -s tests
python cli/archive.py doctor examples/fake-life-archive --strict
```

Expected result:

```text
tests pass
doctor reports 0 errors and 0 warnings
```

## Privacy Boundary

This public repository is not a real user archive.

Do not commit:

- provider tokens,
- local credentials,
- real private zets,
- real source maps,
- real receipts,
- private AI conversations,
- personal files or media,
- local machine paths or private filenames.

Real usage should happen in a private archive repository and separate objet storage/object storage provider.
