# Family Archive Agent Rules

This archive is a shared household or family memory space.

## Read Order

1. Read `archive.yml`.
2. Read relevant `views/*.yml`.
3. Search `zettels/` for canonical family records.
4. Read object manifests only when file metadata is needed.

## Write Policy

- Write AI-generated zettel drafts only to `inbox/`.
- Preserve each person's private archive boundary.
- Child-related records should name the child/dependent as a subject when appropriate.
- Do not expose private source notes from a member's personal archive unless explicitly shared.

## AI Intake Protocol

- BEFORE copying any local file into the archive or an objet store, run `archive source-intake <archive-root> --dry-run --local-path <file>` and follow its `next_safe_actions`.
- Stage capture candidates inside the archive root under `staging/incoming/`, never in a raw in-root `objets/` folder.
- Capture only via `objet-capture-selection` -> `objet-capture` with explicit owner approval; real archives also need an owner-approved `objet-capture-enable` record.
- Bulk external stores are not per-file copies: register evidence with `prehashed-objet-ledger` and `object-storage-upload-evidence` instead.

## AI-Operator Discipline

- PROVENANCE FIDELITY: record the source the human ACTUALLY encountered — the exact video, edition, translation, or language they saw. Never silently swap it for a "more authoritative" or "original" source. If a better source exists, ASK; if it is recorded, keep it as a SEPARATE ref, not a replacement of the encountered one. The archive preserves the provenance of the user's own thought, not the canonical work behind it.
- ENUMERATE TOOLS BEFORE DECLARING IMPOSSIBLE: before you say a task cannot be done or degrade it (e.g. "verbatim capture is not possible, I will summarize"), systematically check the installed and available tools — local CLIs, MCP servers, and the derive-text tool-readiness surface. Do not conclude "impossible" from one or two probes.
- CARRY ESTABLISHED STATE: carry forward what has already been set up or approved in this session or recorded in operational-context (credentials configured, permissions granted, resources present). Do NOT re-ask for or re-confirm already-established state as if first-time. When unsure, CHECK the recorded context (operational-context, receipts) before asking again.

## Plain-Language for Humans

- When you address a HUMAN, translate git/infrastructure/WOM-internal jargon into everyday language; keep the exact technical term in parentheses or in the logs only.
- Say "the update files arrived but the update button hasn't been pressed yet (fetched, not checked out)", not "fetched to the mirror, not checked out".
- Say "a saved bookmark to a specific version (a pin)"; say "the list of which files exist and their fingerprints (the manifest)".
- This governs human-facing prose only. Machine, JSON, and receipt output stays exact and unchanged.

## Succession

Family records about a child should be modeled so they can later be transferred or copied into that child's own archive with provenance.

The family or household may be the owner while parents or guardians are operators. When a child becomes the owner of their own archive later, that change must be represented as an ownership-transfer receipt rather than an invisible folder rename.
